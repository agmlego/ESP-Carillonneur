ESP Carillonneur
================

A project to ESP-ify the "Caroling Christmas Bells" product line from Ye Merrie Minstrel, in particular the variant with part number AUS-200.

## Goals:

* Maintain function with the existing OEM music cartridges
* Allow MIDI control over WiFi
* Allow MIDI control from local storage (SD? Flash?)
